                I am Lia. I am an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University (SFU), 
                majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT), minoring in print and digital publishing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As seen from my programs, I am interested in both visual, graphic UX/UI design and their publication. 
                I have always liked decorating which led me to drawing and eventually into designing.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am always curious about the world that I haven’t experienced. 
                Luckily, I have experienced various cultures, technology and design 
                by having opportunities to live in both Western(Canada and U.S) and Eastern(South Korea) countries. 
                These opportunities helped me develop and open my views to see the bigger world.
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand how the visual information is being presented and want to learn more. 
                I am still studying how the design is seen, being understood, 
                and how effectively the product should be designed to work best for the target users and technology. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am based in Vancouver, but I am willing to go on adventures to achieve my goals and to develop myself.
