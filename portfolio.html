        <h1>Biography / Personal Description</h1>
        <p>
            Hello nice to meet you all, my name is Lia. 
            I am a visual + graphic + UX/UI student from Simon Fraser University 
            majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT),
            minoring in print and digital publishing. 

            I am interested in both print and digital design and publication.
            Ever since I was young I like decorating which led me to drawing 
            and eventually into designing and how the visual information is being presented. 
            I am still studying and learning about how the design is seen, being understood, 
            and be effective based on the users. I could say myself is an open person. 
            I have experienced various cultures, technology and design by having opportunities 
            to live in both western and eastern countries. 
            I am always curious about the world that I havenâ€™t experienced. 
            I have am based in Vancouver, but I am willing to go on adventures to achieve my goals and to develop myself.
        </p>
