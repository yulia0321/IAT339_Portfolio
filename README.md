        <h1>Biography / Personal Description</h1>
        <p>
            Hello nice to meet you all, my name is Lia. 
            I am a visual + graphic + UX/UI student from Simon Fraser University 
            majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT),
            minoring in print and digital publishing. 

            I am interested in both print and digital design and publication.
            Ever since I was young I like decorating which led me to drawing 
            and eventually into designing and how the visual information is being presented. 
            I am still studying and learning about how the design is seen, being understood, 
            and be effective based on the users. I could say myself is an open person. 
            I have experienced various cultures, technology and design by having opportunities 
            to live in both western and eastern countries. 
            I am always curious about the world that I havenâ€™t experienced. 
            I have am based in Vancouver, but I am willing to go on adventures to achieve my goals and to develop myself.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Process Analysis 1: Interface Design</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>first UX/UI project: developing a new application</li>
            <li>developed an application: roomformation</li>
            <li>challenge: originally 5 people project, turned into 2 people project</li>
            <li>survey is being conducted to gather information about the problems of existing products</li>
            <li>interviews are also being processed to have more detailed ideas of what customers want</li>
            <li>multiple continued heuristic evaluations are done to make the experience better</li>
            <li>problems: not sharing enough information -> team knows how the application works 
                assumed just that everyone knows as well. Fixed with the heuristic evaluation.
            </li>

        <h1>Process Analysis 2: Magazine Publishing</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>developing a print and digital medium: Magazine
                <br>
                Not just designing a magazine but choose the topic, audience, niche. And how to business, market and publish.
                It is more of business model and consolidating the services we offer to the customers than the designing the magazine
            </li>
            <li>narrowing down the audience and analyze what services they need and want</li>
            <li>conduct research among the existing products to develop the unique elements or services to our own product</li>
            <li>practice Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) analysis to have strategies</li>
            <li>have discussion about how to promote our services to the market while thinking about the revenue as well</li>
            <li>problems: revenue and profit related calculation was a new area for all team members 
                -> had quite a trouble time to calculate the assumed revenue and profit
            </li>
            <li>-> new challenge for me</li>
            <li>had an opportunities to think and plan about other critically related areas such as business model and marketing</li>
            <li>how design also impact the business, marketing and other areas of the product</li>
            <li>find out and understand ho wto stand out as a unique product</li>
            <li>topic: also new area -> interesting to research</li>
            <li>big understanding of how important to trust the team members</li>
